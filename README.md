Image Recognition System using ML
The Image Recognition System project aims to develop an efficient image recognition model using a Kaggle dataset and essential tools such as TensorFlow from Keras. The project involves training the model, performing validation, normalizing the data, and applying key techniques such as BatchNormalization and Dropout to enhance model performance. The ultimate goal is to achieve accurate results in image classification tasks.
